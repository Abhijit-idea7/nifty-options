# Nifty Weekly Options — Straddle/Strangle Strategy

Day-trading strategy that sells ATM Nifty straddles (or strangles), uses
ORB or Supertrend signals on the **combined call+put premium**, and applies
an India VIX filter for risk management.

Two modes:
- **Backtest** — runs on 30 days of synthetic data (or real CSV data you supply)
- **Paper Trade** — fetches live NSE prices every 5 min, logs real signals & P&L

---

## MODE 1 — Paper Trading (recommended first step)

### Start paper trading in 3 clicks

1. Upload this folder to a new GitHub repository (see bottom of this file)
2. Go to your repo → **Actions tab** → click **"Live Paper Trader (Nifty Straddle)"**
3. Click **"Run workflow"** → fill settings → click green **"Run workflow"**

That's it. Every 5 minutes during market hours (9:15–15:30 IST, Mon–Fri),
GitHub will automatically:
- Fetch live Nifty ATM call + put prices from NSE
- Apply your signal (ORB or Supertrend) on the straddle premium
- Enter/exit paper trades based on your rules
- Save results back to your repository

### View results
- **Live console log**: Actions tab → click any run → see real-time output
- **Trade history**: open `paper_trade_log.csv` in your repo (updates after each exit)
- **P&L summary**: open `paper_pnl_summary.txt`

### Stop paper trading
Actions tab → "Live Paper Trader" → three-dot menu → **Disable workflow**

## MODE 2 — Backtest on historical data

### How to run the backtest on GitHub (no coding required)

### Step 1 — Upload this folder to a new GitHub repository
1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) → **New repository**
2. Give it a name (e.g. `nifty-straddle-backtest`) → click **Create repository**
3. Upload all files from this folder:
   - Click **uploading an existing file** on the repo page
   - Drag-and-drop the entire folder contents → click **Commit changes**

### Step 2 — Run the backtest
1. In your GitHub repo, click the **Actions** tab (top menu)
2. On the left, click **"Run Nifty Straddle Backtest"**
3. Click the **"Run workflow"** button (grey dropdown, top-right of the list)
4. A form appears — fill in your strategy settings (or leave defaults):

| Setting | What it means | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Signal method | `orb` = Opening Range Breakout, `supertrend`, or `both` | `orb` |
| Trade structure | `straddle` = same strike, `strangle` = OTM legs | `straddle` |
| Stop-loss % | Exit if premium rises this much from entry | `50` |
| Target % | Exit if premium falls this much from entry | `30` |
| ORB window | Minutes to calculate opening range | `15` |
| VIX filter | Skip entry / force exit on VIX spikes | `true` |
| Max VIX for entry | Don't enter new trades above this VIX level | `20` |
| VIX exit spike % | Exit if VIX rises this % from your entry VIX | `10` |
| Number of lots | How many Nifty lots to simulate | `1` |

5. Click the green **"Run workflow"** button

### Step 3 — Download results
1. Wait ~2 minutes for the run to finish (green tick ✓)
2. Click the finished run name
3. Scroll down to **Artifacts** → click **"backtest-results"** to download a ZIP
4. The ZIP contains:
   - `backtest_results.png` — equity curve, daily P&L bars, exit reason chart
   - `trade_log.csv` — every trade with entry/exit prices and P&L
   - `metrics_summary.csv` — win rate, Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, etc.

## Strategy Logic

```
EVERY TRADING DAY:

1. Identify ATM strike at market open (nearest 50-point multiple)
2. Build synthetic straddle premium = Call price + Put price (minute bars)
3. Apply indicator on straddle premium:
   - ORB: Calculate opening range (first 15 min). Entry when premium
     breaks BELOW range low (premium contracting = good for short seller)
   - Supertrend: Entry when straddle price goes below Supertrend line

4. ENTRY (all must be true):
   ✓ After 09:30 (ORB window complete)
   ✓ Signal is bearish on straddle premium
   ✓ India VIX below threshold (default 20)
   ✓ No open position today

5. SHORT STRADDLE: Sell ATM Call + Sell ATM Put
   Collect premium = Call price + Put price at entry

6. EXIT (first condition wins):
   A. Stop-loss     — straddle rises 50% from entry (VIX spike / big move)
   B. Target        — straddle falls 30% from entry (time decay + low vol)
   C. Signal flip   — straddle price turns bullish (premium expanding)
   D. VIX spike     — India VIX rises >10% from entry level
   E. EOD square-off — forced exit at 15:15 regardless

7. P&L = (Entry premium − Exit premium) × Lot size × Number of lots
```

## Understanding the signals

**ORB (Opening Range Breakout) on straddle premium:**
- If the straddle premium is falling below the morning low → market is
  calm, IV is dropping → good time to be short premium
- If the premium breaks above the morning high → volatility expanding →
  exit immediately

**Supertrend on straddle premium:**
- Works like Supertrend on a stock price chart, but applied to the
  combined option premium
- Below the Supertrend line = premium in downtrend = short-friendly
- Above the Supertrend line = premium rising = exit signal

**India VIX filter:**
- High VIX = expensive options + uncertain market = risky to be short
- VIX > 20 at entry → skip the trade entirely
- VIX spikes 10% during the trade → exit immediately to protect P&L

## Using real data (future step)

Replace `data/sample_nifty_options_data.csv` with real historical data
from your broker. The CSV must have these columns:

```
datetime, nifty_spot, strike,
call_open, call_high, call_low, call_close,
put_open,  put_high,  put_low,  put_close,
vix
```

Data providers that export this format: Zerodha Kite, Upstox, Fyers,
Quantsapp, Opstra, NSE Bhav Copy (with some pre-processing).
